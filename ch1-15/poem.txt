Tyger tyger burning bright, in the forest of the night
What inmortal hand or eye, could frame the fearful symetry
Write: tyger tyger burning bright
rame the fearful symetry
In what distance deep the sky burn the fire of the eye

What shoulder what art, could twist the snew of that heart
And when that heart begin to beat
what dread hand and what dread feet
